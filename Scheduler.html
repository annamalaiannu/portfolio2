					Prior to Scheduler, our Project managers scrambled between a bunch of planning software, spreadsheets, docs and emails to create project launches. There were too many separate pieces to connect, fit together, and update. A lot of time was spent managing the schedule even when actual work started. Project managers had to manage the details rather than on strategy.

				<p class="para-text"> Looking at the data and talking to PMs, made it clear that a lot of them were scrambling across applications to create a schedule. They needed a simple way to plan a schedule, assign tasks and allocate resources. </p>

Both collaboration and efficiency increased. It was a great sign to have customers onboard, even before the initial release.
