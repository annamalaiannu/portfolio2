            With our users expecting to do an increasing number of things on the
            mobile app, inconsistencies started to creep in, in both the flow
            and information architecture. We had to craft a more accessible,
            understandable app that affords all of Construct’s existing features
            in a consistent, logical and coherent manner.

            Over time, the demands of the Construct app have grown
            exponentially. What started as a tool for managing tasks, updating
            drawings and recording daily logs, must now meet the needs of
            on-site workers across cities, in different situations – responding
            to schedule update requests, conducting inspections during different
            phases of a project, raising safety observations or even recording
            the observed weather conditions. Construct was being used for a
            variety of things that were never imagined at its inception. We
            worked closely with our PM’s and on-site team both in India and the
            US, to design a better app.

            Exploring the Pain Points
          </h2>
          <p class="para-text">
            We were maintaining a log of pain points (across the app) internally,
            noting down the pain points we need to address. Even before the
            redesign effort commenced, we had a good sense of our users’
            pain points:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><i>"We want the app to be prompt and engaging."</i></li>
            <li><i>"I spend a lot of time to create an observation."</i></li>

          <p class="para-text">
            We didn’t just want to address the major pain points, we wanted to
            refresh the identity of the app and build a simple, frictionless
            experience for our users.

            1. Our users were spending more than 7 seconds to simply understand
            the form while creating an observation. They found it complex and
            unintuitive.
          </h2>
          <p class="para-text">
            Our users found the old UI confusing and overwhelming. They spent
            more 7 seconds understanding the form and over 400 seconds to
            complete the process. We had users reporting not finding particular
            fields / calls-to-action, when in fact they were present. Often they
            had to return to the form, since they missed certain details.

          <p class="para-text">
            We realised our users were scanning instead of reading. The first
            thing users did when they saw the form was, estimate how long it
            would take to complete it. Perception was crucial. When they saw too
            many fields, they were quick to abandon the process.

            The old design presented all the fields stacked one below the other.
            The lack of hierarchy and structure and an increasing number of
            fields, made the form difficult to comprehend. The mental and
            physical load on the user were too high.
          </p>

          <p class="para-text">
            Our users were hesitant to fill out forms. So, our goal was to make
            the process of filling out a form as easy as possible. We looked to
            avoid clutter and build on existing mental models of our users. We
            used a simple layout to make it look familiar and reduce the amount
            of learning.

            wanted to see Observation Title, Status, Due Date, Priority and
