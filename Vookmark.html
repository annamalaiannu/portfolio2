					Vookmark is a cross platform app that allows users to bookmark videos across popular streaming platforms and watch them later on a device of their choice.
				</p>

				<p class="para-text">
					Vookmark was built in-house by NFN Labs. I was apart of the team right from day 1, when we were dabbling with the idea of building this product in the first place. 
					As the lead UX designer for Vookmark, I was responsible for the full design effort, including the website, mobile app, internal dashboards, blog, social media, and the pitch deck.
				</p>
				<p class="para-text">
					This article is a brief overview of how we went about building Vookmark.

				 <h2 class="para-title">
				 Should we build Vookmark in the first place?
				</h2>
				<p class="para-text">
					To validate this question we went around getting the perspective of friends and colleagues in our office. We were quick to realise that our potential target audience weren't very different from us. We wanted to dig into the information in and around us. After a few informal talks across teams, we realised that through Vookmark, we were addressing an actual user need, that many of us within the office faced.
				</p>

				<p class="para-text">
					Though at different points during the day, a majority of us were watching videos on Youtube, Facebook, Vimeo and even Reddit. And there was always at least one video we really wanted to watch but couldn't , during the course of the day.

				 Deciding on the initial Feature Set: What should the app do?
				</h2>
				<p class="para-text"> Some of the initial questions we had, </p>
			<p class="para-text">
				<ul>
				<li>	What should the landing screen look like? Should it be a feed? </li>
				<li>	Should the user be able to add tags? </li>
				<li>	Should he be able to create and share video playlists? </li>
				<li>	Would the user want to see collections of videos categories? </li>
				<li>	Should the user be able to share Vookmark videos? </li>
				<li>	What happens when the user shares a bookmarked (or vookmarked ;)) video to a non-Vookmark user? Should we prompt him to download the app to view it? </li>
			</ul></p>
				<p class="para-text"> Before deciding what to build we wanted to ensure that we didn’t get lost on a tangent and forget the real user need </p>
				<p class="para-text"> We decided our primary focus would be on solving the following questions, </p>
			<p class="para-text"><ul>
				<li>	 How do we make booking marking videos convenient and seamless? </li>
				<li>	 How do we get users into the habit of bookmarking videos? </li>
				<li>	 How do we remind the user that he can always vookmark the video without distracting him from the streaming experience? </li>
				<li>	 How do we make the experience personalised? </li>

			</p></ul>
					We decided to keep the landing page simple. On opening the app the user would see a his list of bookmarked videos.

			<div class="row">
				 <h2 class="para-title">
				 How does the user bookmark videos across platforms and across devices to watch later?
				</h2>
				<p class="para-text">
					Through testing a range of medium fidelity prototypes, we started understanding what the ideal process to bookmark videos should be.
				</p>
				<h3 class="para-heading">
					Vookmarking videos on the web
				</h3>
			<p class="para-text"><ul>
				<li>  On the web, the user would first have to download the browser extension to start saving videos. </p>
				<li>  After the extension is installed, the user can save videos by clicking on the Vookmark button or icon. </p>
			</ul></p>
				<h3 class="para-heading">
					Vookmarking videos on Mobile/iPad

				 Our Failures
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						After our initial release we had users asking us on why we didn't have a web app. In retrospect, not having the web app as part of our initial release was a mistake. We went in with a mobile first approach. This meant that while users would be able to bookmark videos on both the web and mobile, they would have to switch back to their phones or tablets to watch the videos.
					</li>
					<br>
						<li>
							Users wanted to have the option to bookmark videos
							on right click. Luckily for us our web app was only
							a week away from its release and a minor tweak was
							enough to allow users to save videos on right click.
						</li>
				</ul>

				 Key Takeaways
				</h2>
				<p class="para-text">
					Looking back, Vookmark was a huge learning for me. The sheer amount of knowledge I gained within a few months was humbling.
				</p>
				<p class="para-text">
					Building a product from scratch, and going through the complete design process - gathering requirements, wire framing, iterating and prototyping relentlessly, learning from user feedback - and watching my designs come to life was a special experience.
				</p>
				<p class="para-text">
					There were a lot of firsts for me - from wearing the hat of a design lead to designing content for social media to seeing how design decisions impact business.
