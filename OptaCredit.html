            term loans for all employees working in partnered organisations.

            The Fintech space, especially the online lending domain was
            something I knew very little about. I decided to glance an older
            version of the website to get myself familiar with the product and
            broad user goals. I decided to note down what I understood. But I
            could there was very little that I could make sense of. It became
            quite evident to me that, I was solving a communication problem and
            not exactly a business or design problem. This being my first
            assignment I was, like most others, keen to make a mark.
          </p>
          <p class="para-text">
            I decided to look at how companies which were solving a problem
            similar to the problem we were trying to solve. I did a detailed
            competitive analysis of each competitor. I jotted down the structure
            of each landing page, and my thoughts as a first time user on what
            worked well and what didn’t as well.

            Here I was in a design studio trying to solve a problem (one that I
            knew very little about) for people who aren’t like me. It was

            I decided to do competitive analyses to better understand the

            looked at companies tackling the same problem in India and abroad. I
            became aware of subtle nuances that arise as the market and
            target audience change. Going through this process boosted my
            confidence, helped me build a sense of empathy with the customers
            and gain a firmer grasp of the problem.

          <p class="para-text">
            We decided to go in with a simple structure and convey OptaCredit’s
            goal in people language. We wanted to ensure that the landing page
            focused on people’s goals and not on OptaCredit’s goals.
          </p>
          <p class="para-text">
            We wanted to the landing page to convey a sense of honesty and
            openness of product, branding, message. We knew that if the users
            feel like there is some hidden catch to using or buying the product,
            we will lose their trust.

            <strong class="semibold">1. White Space and Visual Clutter -</strong>
            While looking at landing pages, I realised that a healthy amount of
            white space and minimal visual clutter, made it easy for users to
            decide what action they are supposed to take (especially first time
            users and novices).

              2. A Punchline (< 10 words) + One prominent eye catching CTA -
            </strong>
            Since we were looking at lead conversion, we didn’t want the users
            to get distracted by too many extraneous links, and actions that
            wouldn’t result in conversion.

            While we had a content writer working on the copy, I conveyed our
            goal which was to convey OptaCredit’s value in simple people
            language in large font sizes. We looked to use
            <strong class="semibold">plain spoken words (12th grade level).</strong>

          <p class="para-text-opta">
            <strong class="semibold">4. Simple information architecture -</strong>
            I adopted a simple layout and structure to reduce the amount of
            learning for first time users. People had mental models of how
            websites work and I looked to tap into that.

            We aimed to convey the real user problems that Optacredit is
            solving. We didn’t want to talk about Optacredit the company and its
            business goals. I used
            <strong class="semibold">
              visual cues where possible such as the 4 step side bar
            </strong>
            , to communicate to the user that
            <strong class="semibold">
              securing a personal loan is going to be quick and simple with
              OptaCredit.

          <p class="para-text-opta">
            <strong class="semibold">6. Building Trust and sealing the deal -</strong>
            To get first time users sign up, we had to make them trust
            OptaCredit as a brand and take a leap of faith. A tried and tested
            way to do that was through testimonials. This was the section that
            would eliminate doubt and persuade users to get onboard. I felt
            including the primary CTA in this section crucial as it would nudge
            the users to try OptaCredit.

            stakeholders and iterating based on feedback.
